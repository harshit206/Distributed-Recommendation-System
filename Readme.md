## Outline  
1. Loaded the data from AWS S3 and preprocessed 73 million rows of social media data using Spark and stored in MongoDB Atlas.
2. Generated keyword embeddings using word2vec architecture on userâ€™s activity data and applied logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a user following an account.
